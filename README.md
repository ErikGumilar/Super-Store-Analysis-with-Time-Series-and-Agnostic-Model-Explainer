3 years ago, when the **COVID-19** virus spread to all corners of the world, the wheels of the economy came to a complete standstill, causing a worldwide **Recession**. All sectors of the world's economy seemed to be hit by a big storm that caused world chaos. The rapidly spreading **COVID-19** has made the world not yet prepared to face the wave of the threat of a recession.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has plunged **[Japan into a Recession](https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/dunia-52706881)** and analysts say it is likely to "record its worst economic performance" since World War II. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the world's third largest economy (Japan) plunged 27.8% in the second quarter, compared to the same period last year. The same thing is also experienced by developed countries in the blue continent, Europe. **Germany**, the largest economy in Europe, is haunted by the COVID-19 outbreak that has dragged the country's economy into a recession. In a **[CNBC Indonesia](https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/news/20200515174420-4-158868/pandemi-covid-19-seret-ekonomi-jerman-ke-dalam-jurang-resesi)** release, the **German** economy plunged into recession after experiencing its steepest quarterly contraction since the 2009 financial crisis.

A superpower like the **United States** is also haunted by the same economic problems. On the **[CNN Indonesia](https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20200730205504-532-530871/melihat-ekonomi-as-yang-ikut-terjebak-resesi-akibat-corona)** page, in the first quarter of 2020, the US economy was minus 5 percent. Then, it fell 32.9 percent in the second quarter of 2020. The decline in **US** economic performance was the worst since 1974 when it entered the brink of recession following Germany, South Korea, and Singapore, which had already experienced this condition. COVID-19 really has an impact on all sectors and all countries in the world.

In 2021 and 2022, many economists and business professionals project that the retail business will gradually improve by the end of 2021 and throughout 2022. It is also released by **[Kompas.com](https://money.kompas.com/read/2021/10/11/144926726/bi-proyeksikan-kinerja-penjualan-ritel-membaik-bertahap)**, Bank Indonesia estimates that retail sales performance in September 2021 will gradually improve. This is stated in the Results of the Retail Sales Survey1 (SPE) in August 2021.

Based on the forecasts of these economists, as a member of the **Business Analyst** in a retail company, we are asked to analyze the products that contribute the highest profit and predict the number of transactions and buyers in the next 3 months based on the company's daily data. The results are then presented in the form of a Dashboard.
